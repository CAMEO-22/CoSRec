# CoSRec <img src="images/logo.png" alt="CAMEO" width="200" align="right"/>

CoSRec is the first dataset explicitly designed for joint Conversational Search and Recommendation (CSR) tasks.  
CoSRec comprises approximately 9,000 user-system conversations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the product search and recommendation domain. These conversations encompass a variety of interactions, including pure search, pure recommendation, and mixed search-and-recommendation utterances.  
To ensure the quality of the dataset, a sample of approximately 3% of the conversations has been manually annotated to identify user intents and assess overall quality. Additionally, for 20 high-quality conversations, we provide utterance-level human-generated relevance judgments for items or documents, depending on the intent of the utterance. These annotations enable precise and effective evaluation of joint CSR systems.
A key feature of CoSRec is its agnosticism toward underlying systems and evaluation paradigms. To address this, CoSRec includes separate ground truths for search and recommendation tasks, allowing researchers to apply diverse evaluation paradigms and methodologies.

CoSRec includes 9,249 conversations split into 3 partitions: 
- CoSRec-Raw: 8,938 non-annotated conversations containing 71,656 utterances.
- CoSRec-Crowd: 291 human-annotated conversations including 2,329 utterances.
- CoSRec-Curated: 20 deeply human-annotated conversations containing 150 utterances.

### Dataset

This directory holds the files constituting the CoSRec dataset, which is splitted in 3 partitions: CoSRec Raw, CoSRec Crowd, CoSRec Curated.

#### CoSRec Raw
CoSRec Raw is a set of 8938 non-annotated conversations.  

The file **conversations.jsonl** contains a conversation for each line. Each conversation corresponds to a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, the conversation text. The user's utterances start with "U:" and are separated from the system's utterances, starting with "S:" by means of "\n".

#### CoSRec Crowd

CoSRec Raw is a set of 291 annotated conversations.  

This partitions contains the following files:

-  **conversations.jsonl**: json file containing a conversation for each line. Each conversation corresponds to a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, the conversation text. The user's utterances start with "U:" and are separated from the system's utterances, starting with "S:" by means of "\n".
-  **quality.jsonl**: json file containing the ratings provided by the annotators during the quality assessment. Each line of the file corresponds to a conversation. Each conversation takes the form of a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, the list of ratings. The list is composed of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to the ratings of a user and has as keys the quality aspects ('coherence', 'logicality', 'informativeness', 'fluency') and as values the ratings provided by the annotator.
-  **intent_annotations.jsonl**: json file containing the raw human-labelled intents. Each line of the file corresponds to a conversation. Each conversation takes the form of a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, the list of intents for each utterance. The list is composed of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to an utterance and has two fields: the utterance id ('utterance'), which is the index of the user utterance in the conversation, and the intent list ('intent_annotations'). The intent list is constituted by a sequence of lists, each representing the intents identified for the considered utterance by a single annotator. For each intent we report the type ('type') and the stand-alone formulation ('query').
-  **profiles.jsonl**: json file containing the profile summaries of the users considered for each conversation. Each line of the file corresponds to a conversation. Each conversation takes the form of a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, a dictionary containing the user profiles summaries. The user profiles summaries dictionary has as keys the IDs of the considered users and as values the summaries of the users' profiles.
-  **keywords.jsonl**: json file containing the profile keywords of the users considered for each conversation. Each line of the file corresponds to a conversation. Each conversation takes the form of a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, a dictionary containing the user profiles keywords. The user profiles keywords dictionary has as keys the IDs of the considered users and as values the lists of keywords of the user.

#### CoSRec Curated

CoSRec Raw is a set of 20 deeply annotated conversations, where the raw annotator data is manually reviewed by the authors.  

This partitions contains the following files:
-  **conversations.jsonl**: same as CoSRec Crowd.
-  **quality.jsonl**: same as CoSRec Crowd. Each line of the file corresponds to a conversation. Each conversation takes the form of a dictionary with a single key, the conversation ID, and a single value, the list of intents for each utterance. The list is composed of dictionaries. Each dictionary corresponds to an utterance and has two fields: the utterance id ('utterance'), which is the index of the user utterance in the conversation, and the intent list ('intents'). The intent list is constituted by a sequence of dictionaries, each representing a single intents  and reporting: the intent id ('id'), the intent type ('type') and the list of stand-alone formulaitons ('query_variants'). **Note:** this file does NOT contain the personalized recommendation intents, they can be generated by combining this file and the 'keywords.jsonl' files.
-  **intents.jsonl**: json file containing the reviewd human-labelled intents.
-  **profiles.jsonl**: same as CoSRec Crowd.
-  **keywords.jsonl**: same as CoSRec Crowd.
-  **qrels.qrels**: file containing the relevance judgments for all the intents in TREC-style format (NOTE: the ground truth can be splitted in search ground truth and recommendation ground truth based on the topic id. The recommendation topic ids contain the cheracter '#' while the search topic ids do not).

**Note:** the intent id (file 'intents.jsonl') takes the following form: <conversation_id>_<utterance_id>_<index> where: conversation_id is the identifier of the conversation, utterance_id is the identifier of the utterance (index) WITHIN the conversation and <index> is an incremental field (counter) used to differentiate the identifiers of different intents referring to the same utterance.

**Note:** the id of the personalized intents in the qrels file  ('qrels.qrels') takes the following form: <intent_id>#<user_index> where: intent_id is the id of the intent (structured as explained above) and user_index is a reference to the user for which the intent is personalized. In particular, the user_index is an integer number between 0 and 4, which correspond to the index of the user in the list of users employed to personalize the intents of the considered conversation (**ordered by lexical order of the users' identifiers**).

### Scripts

This directory holds the scripts needed to process the Amazon Reviews dataset and obtain its filtered version (AR-filtered).

### Prompts

This directory contains the prompts used in the interaction with LLama 3.1 8B: 

- The prompt used to generate the conversations corresponds to the file **"conversation_generation_prompt.txt"**.
- The prompt used to extract a search-like query from a product (to be used as request for the retrieval of 10 documents from MS Marco v2.1 Passage) corresponds to the file **"product_to_query_prompt.txt"**.
- The prompt used to create the user profile summary from the user's reviews is **"user_summary_prompt.txt"**.
- The prompt used to generate the user profile keywords from the user's reviews is **"user_keywords_prompt.txt"**.
