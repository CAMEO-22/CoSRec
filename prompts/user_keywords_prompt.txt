I will provide you with the review texts written by a user about some Amazon products they have purchased.
Generate from 1 to 5 keywords from the provided user reviews. The keywords should capture
the main user interests. Therefore, they should be representative of the aspects that the user
considers important in its reviews. ATTENTION: the keywords must be general and not related to a specific product.
The keywords must summarize the general aspects in which the user is most interested in when buying the products (e.g. robust, cheap, durable, flexible, etc.).

IMPORTANT: the 1 to 5 keywords must summarize all the reviews, I do NOT want different keywords for each review.

Such keywords should help a recommender system to suggest more relevant products for their future purchasing needs.

YOU MUST provide an output that contains the text of the keywords separated by semicolons, without any additional text.
The complete list of keywords should be enclosed between curly brackets.


The data that I will provide is composed of a list of review texts, ranging from 1 up to 10 reviews, using the
following format:

[Review <k>] =
title of review
text of review

, where k=1,2,3,... is the number of the review considered.
